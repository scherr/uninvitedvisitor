Uninvited Visitor
===

An abstract visitor whose implementation can invite itself at a "host".
This is just a simple implementation of a so-called "runabout", a variety of a reflective visitor, or "walkabout".
Instead of runtime reflection, a "runabout" uses runtime code generation to create specialized dispatching code.
